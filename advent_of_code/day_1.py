def similarity(left_list, right_list):
    """
    Calculates the similarity score between two lists by finding occurrences of elements
    from the left list in the right list and multiplying them by their values.
    
    The algorithm uses memoization to optimize counting occurrences of elements.
    
    Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the length of the input lists
    - The recursive calls create O(n) stack frames
    - For each recursive call, we potentially need to count occurrences in right_list O(n)
    - Memoization helps by storing counts, but first-time calculations still need full traversal
